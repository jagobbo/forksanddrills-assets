To avoid the spread of inadequate ways to evaluate the assets is recommended to have a method for that.
We need to simplify with essential topics such as:

- Brush
  - Stain (The stain represents the tool concept? Yes or not? How does it work? Poor, regular or optimal?)
  - Scaling (How does the scaling work, poor, regular or optimal in the range usual for this tool in 300 and 600 ppi documents?)
  - Performance (poor, regular, optimal)
  - Notes and improvements

- Dynamics
  - Opacity (How does the opacity work on the preset? Poor, regular or optimal?).
  - Size (How does the Size work, the behaviour is: hard, regular and softer?)
  - Other interactions (Other parameters used are working adequately to this tool or behaviour? Poor, regular or Optimal)
  - Generic or Specific (The dynamics is a **Unique** asset or could be **Shared** with other presets and brushes?)
  - Performance (Poor, regular, optimal)
  - Notes and improvements

- Tool Preset
  - Behaviour - (The scope of the preset corresponds with the tool name? Poor, regular or optimal?)
  - Notes and improvements
        
- Medium Behaviour
All presets for painting tasks are normally related to medium, materials or a specific tool, e.g., the Sfumino or Smudge tool (I like the Sfumino term;). This quality evaluation aims to classify each medium, material and tool with a grade of effectiveness.
For instance, how is the medium behaviour on the set Poor, regular or optimal? This field evaluation is in the 'Isolated or Shared Method' View. This evaluation will be done for the sets and separately for the unique presets following the same criteria: poor, regular and optimal.

The Criteria Numeric
- Poor, Regular and Optimal are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- Hard, Regular and Softer on Dynamics Size are 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
- Unique and Shared Method is 1 and 2.

The criteria are essentially qualitative and not quantitative, or rather, when we see the behaviour or we are analysing the performance we are using personal criteria that are based on our idea to create a generic set for many targets and machines. About the performance, we have a Linux box with different performances and this is good... because my machine is older.
